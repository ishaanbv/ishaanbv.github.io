		This document may or may not fit the definition of a typical manifesto as it resembles more of a document that contains the evolution and/or disposal of my belief systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		→You must study and do well.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		I have come to realise that I am entirely a product of my surroundings, time, and upbringing. It is through the things I have been taught and have been exposed to that I create. My creations, I suppose, are manifestations of how I interpret my surroundings and hence everything as well as everyone have a hand in the things I create.
	</p>

	<p>
		We all have high expectations and hopes for you. Having been born into a civilised "semi-wealthy" household, you are going to be extremely successful one day. Of course, a successful life is one defined by economic and positional stability. To take on the family business is only the most honourable act one can commit as a form of gratitude, respect and support to those who came before you and one day soon, you'll be respected just like your father is now. Learn from your elders as they will set you on the right path. Never lie, this is the highest form of disrespect you can show your family. Study math and science and do well, only then you will succeed. Failure will not be accepted as it is not an option. We all want you to grow up and become a doctor or an engineer or a lawyer, this will win you the highest reputation and raise your family’s name in the eyes of your community. You must study and do well. Don’t waste your time playing games, be it digital or analogue. They will ruin your mind when you can be using it to solve equations and physics numericals. Don’t watch too much tv, you'll ruin your eyes and need glasses. You can’t have long hair because you are a boy. Do not cry because only girls do. As a boy you must look out for girls and especially as a brother, you must protect your sisters. As a man, you must be the head of your family and have a reputable job to support them.  
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		 Yet even though I am a result of the people and experiences I have been exposed to, society seems to thrive within constraint. Comprehension is not a universal constant which one may say is obvious, but I say it isn't universal at all. The problem with trying to understand somebody else's thoughts and feelings is that you’re using your own thoughts and feelings to do the reasoning. You start from a disadvantage you can never surpass because you cannot assume their thoughts and feelings without actually stepping outside your own. We have managed to construct levels of universality in the way we comprehend each other by creating and subjecting ourselves along with our progeny to systems of unnatural hierarchy and organisation. People are separated by exposure and personal experience and hence have been united by man-made customs and traditions so as to successfully propagate their own ideas.
	</p>

	<p>
		→You must respect and listen to your elders.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		I used to try to empathise with others feelings and I understand it being possible but it is only to the extent where the other party has shared several experiences and aspects of upbringing. Now having been a part of two communities that inhabit almost opposite sides of the globe, I would like to distinguish extreme points of conflicting "truths" that have been medicinally lodged into my belief systems. Human beings are social creatures yet community vs individuality is a balanced scale. One does not take precedence over the other. In India, community is administered while in America, individuality is. This fundamental difference has created tectonic collisions that have destabilised a cultivated confidence.
	</p>

	<p>
		Show respect to your elders. Everything you have now is because of them, the most important of all is your name. Without your name, you are nothing and will never amount to anything. Your elders will always support you if whatever you do is aligned with the interests and goals of the community. You must always touch their feet if you want their blessing. Forgetfulness will not be tolerated and will be construed as an insult. It is through their wisdom you will know how to conduct yourself. Your grandfather had to walk his way to school through a village every day with only a single set of uniform clothes and holes in his shoes and now he is a prestigious doctor who set up the first clinic/hospital in Bihar. You must aspire to achieve success like he did. The only way you can achieve this is by studying hard and doing well. Playing with pencils and computers will not get you anywhere and is only a waste of time.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		The systems of values are so effectively ingrained almost genetically that I have been deluded into thinking they originated from within me. I only realised this when I stepped out of the community that instilled these "teachings" in me. Not even being aware there are alternatives, one accepts teaching as truth. Yet, as mentioned earlier, neither set of values from different communities are better than one another. The significance lies in the fact that variations exist. Variations imply choice. Variation implies something other than truth. Not falsehoods but differences.
	</p>

	<p>
		→You must carry forward your family name.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		I can not only choose what values I believe in from ones that already exist but also create my own. Simply realising that is a liberation from unacknowledged restraints. Everything we are taught in regards to traditions, customs, rules, law, governing entities, partnerships, relationships, good, bad, success, failure, security, identity, etc, are all unnatural human-constructs that we subject ourselves to all in the name of "civilised" societies. Unnatural is not a bad thing, but does imply the possibility of change and we seem to have forgotten that. None of it is gospel when in fact, all of it is. 
	</p>

	<p>
		You are a pure innocent boy so do not, for once, initiate a friendship with the opposite gender with any intent beyond friendship. Make friends with those who are of the same stature as you and never with anyone below you. Do not burden yourself with finding a partner. Public display of affection will not be tolerated and will bring shame to your family. Marriage is a financial and economic agreement that we as your parents and society will manage for you. We will find you a wife to marry for you must make sure your family name is carried forward by a boy child. Do not disappoint us with a girl child. Do not insult your family with the obligation of paying a dowry as well as discontinuing their name.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		It seems like human beings (me included) require some form of "truth" that allow them a sense of calm or a temporary distraction. This truth can take any shape and need not be backed by factual evidence. More often than not, it is the lack of such evidence that makes a truth even stronger. A belief in a truth cannot be broken unless evidence disproves its foundation, consequently, if no such evidence exists, the belief cannot and will not be demolished. That is the sheer might of a value system.
	</p>

	<p>
		→You must be a devout Hindu.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		It's the same as religion. Both are constructed and disseminated as truths. Instead of religions, these value systems manifest themselves into nations with fictitious borders and governments. We build our lives around these structures while they simultaneously shape our identities. It is less blatant than religion and almost invisible as external entities that we wrongly recognise as ourselves.
	</p>

	<p>
		Follow God, Hinduism is all there is and ever will be, and you will live free of harm. God is a blanket of protection and security for you and your family. God lives within you and around you. God is always watching and judging so never act in any way that would betray Him. Pray every day because praying is good for you and will keep you in God's favour. Puja is fundamental to life the same way breathing and eating is. Do not trust those who do not believe in Hinduism and do not associate with those who are enslaved by other faiths for the creation of Hinduism's adversary is worse than being an atheist. Live by God, live with God, and live for God.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		Meaninglessness and arbitrariness, especially when it comes to our existence, does not sit well. We cannot sit by thinking about the futility of consciousness. So we must create our own meanings to believe in. They may or may not be necessary and definitely not shared by everyone, but all of them are valid. I understand that many of these beliefs will and absolutely do clash and may lead to extreme moments of tragedy and destruction. I obviously do not condone the belief systems that infringe on those of others, resulting in death, pain, discrimination, and destruction, however I am saying that everyone is human and that to create beliefs is human.
	</p>

	<p>
		→You must be everything we want you to be.
	</p>

	<p class="white">
		Comprehension is not universal and hence neither are any systems of belief, value or importance. Deceptively simple systems like right and wrong, being polite/considerate as opposed to being rude/over-bearing are truly complex. I have now lived on opposite sides of the planet alongside extremely contrasting societies and cultures. India, despite accommodating a myriad kind of people, they are all originally from within the Indian subcontinent. There is no other blood running through their veins other than that that has come from civilisations that have existed within the subcontinent or its immediate ancient neighbours (none of whom exist today). We have very much the same history and experiences that have shaped us into what we are today. America on the other hand, is a nation of people from other nations who all bring with them their unique histories and experiences. This manifests itself in various systems of belief that has come to shape understanding. A sentence on one side of the planet is something very different on the other.

		Except for your name, you do not deserve anything and hence you must earn everything. Except for who you were born to, you are entitled to nothing. Except for your place in hierarchical society, nothing belongs to you so you must establish your reputation. Except for the colour of your skin, you must take care of how you look to be attractive. Except for your hereditary wealth, you must work hard to get a prestigious job.
